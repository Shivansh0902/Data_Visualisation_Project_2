## 🛠️ Visualisation Methodology

The dashboard was built using **Tableau Public**, applying a range of visual idioms to convey complex ecological data intuitively:

### 🔍 Chart Types & Rationale:
| Chart Type        | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Stream Graph       | Shows cumulative temporal change in water quality indicators            |
| Area Chart         | Highlights long-term contribution of variables like salinity and DO     |
| Stacked Bar Chart  | Compares nitrogen and phosphorus levels across different locations      |
| Line + Stacked Bars| Visualises interaction between phosphorus and other indicators          |
| Heatmap            | Displays temperature trends across years and sites                      |
| Bullet Chart       | Assesses pH levels against benchmark values                             |

### 🧩 Features:
- Dynamic tooltips
- Reference lines and threshold markers
- Year and site filters
- Consistent colour schemes for readability
- Annotation callouts for significant trends

## 💡 Key Insights

- Seasonal and yearly fluctuations in nutrient levels
- Site-specific anomalies in temperature and pH
- Rising salinity trends in some regions
- Deviations from ecological benchmarks (e.g., ideal pH range)

These insights help evaluate the **impact of climate change, industrial activity**, and **land-use change** in the Western Port region.
