## 📈 Visualisation Techniques

The dashboard uses multiple visual idioms (chart types) to display complex time-series and cross-sectional data effectively:

| Chart Type           | Purpose                                                                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stream Graph**     | Illustrates cumulative changes in overall water quality over time       |
| **Area Chart**       | Highlights contributions of salinity and dissolved oxygen year-on-year  |
| **Stacked Bar Chart**| Compares phosphorus and nitrogen levels across monitoring sites         |
| **Line + Bar Chart** | Shows nutrient fluctuations and site variability simultaneously         |
| **Heatmap**          | Displays temperature patterns across locations and time                 |
| **Bullet Chart**     | Highlights pH values compared to ecological benchmarks                  |
